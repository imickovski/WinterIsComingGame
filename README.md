# WinterIsComingGame
This is my 3 Week at Ironhack Bootcamp Berlin.
Project to develop a simple game, I'm using p5 library and DOM Manipulation.

p5 is a library and set of tools that make it easy to use the JavaScript programming language for creative coding.

DOM Manipulation is used to upgrate the score, make the starting button interactive to start the game again, the button Play Again to reset the game and start over again.

#Description 
The game is about the Nightking building his army from "Game of Thrones" collecting "Brandon Stark" increases the score and interfere with "Arya Stark", it ends the game.
